# SC1007-Data-Structures-Algorithm
This course aims to (i) teach the concepts, implementations and applications of data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues and trees that are important for building efficient algorithms; (ii) provide an introduction to algorithm analysis and design. 

## Course Content
This course has covered several fundamental concepts regarding data structures and algorithm. All code was written in C programming language. Concepts covered in the module include:

1. Linked Lists
2. Stacks & Queues
3. Binary Trees
4. Binary Search Trees
5. Hash Table
6. Graph Representation
7. Breadth-First Search (BFS) + Depth-First Search (DFS)
8. Backtracking & Permutation
9. Dynamic Programming
10. Bipartite Graph - Matching Problem
11. Analysis of Algorithm
